Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game repository! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

Features
Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same device.
Win detection: The game detects when a player has won by lining up three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw condition: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Restart functionality: Easily reset the game and start over.
How to Play
Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".
Players take turns selecting an empty cell on the grid.
The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw.
Technologies Used
only use c++
